Placement of the sensors
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++//
Our placement of the sensors is based upon testing and verification from several tests of the edge-cases, such as one train running at max speed and one train running at the lowest possible speed. We also discovered that placing two sensors to close to eachother meant that one of the signals could be "lost". Therefore we placed one sensor in each curve instead of using one for the trains moving up the track and one for the trains moving down the track. 
Also, placing the sensors to close to a crossing or trackswitch made the trains crash if we ran a train at max speed and the other at a low speed for different reasons;
- trainswitches beacuse there alread was a train on the switch because the trains didnt have time to stop
- crossings beacuse the fast train could run into the tail of the slow train.

For the same reason the max speed that our traintrack can handle is 15. Otherwise the trains will collide at the crossing and the train will cover a switch when trying to flip it.

Choice of critical sections
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++//

We chose to make every railroad where only one train can go at the same time
as critical sections. That is quite obvious since the trains would collide
otherwise. We also chose to make the way without turns the "main" railroad and
only take an alternate route if the main road were occupied by the other
train. This means that we decided to have every part of the main road as
critical sections but not the smaller alternative roads. 

We decided that all parts that included an end station should be a critical
section that was acquired when entering that part and kept until the train had
gone into reverse and left the end station part.

Maximum train speed and the reason for it
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++//

As mentioned earlier the max speed of the trains are 15 but is easily
changeable to accept higher speeds by moving the sensors further from the
crossing and switches. If we were to try and run the trains at speeds greater
than 15 in this version of the map the trains will sooner or later collide or
try to flip a switch when there is a train on it, since the trains don't
manage to stop before the switch/crossing.
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++//

How you tested your solution
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++//

We've tested the solution by running the trains for quite some time at max
speed as well as speed=1, and also when one train goes at max speed while the
other is running at the speed 1.
