Placement of the sensors
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++//
Our placement of the sensors is based upon testing and verification from several tests of the edge-cases, such as one train running at max speed and one train running at the lowest possible speed. We also discovered that placing two sensors to close to eachother meant that one of the signals could be "lost". Therefore we placed one sensor in each curve instead of using one for the trains moving up the track and one for the trains moving down the track. 
Also, placing the sensors to close to a crossing or trackswitch made the trains crash if we ran a train at max speed and the other at a low speed for different reasons;
- trainswitches beacuse there alread was a train on the switch because the trains didnt have time to stop
- crossings beacuse the fast train could run into the tail of the slow train.

For the same reason the max speed that our traintrack can handle is 15. Otherwise the trains will collide at the crossing and the train will cover a switch when trying to flip it.
